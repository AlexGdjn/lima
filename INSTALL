LIMA - Libre Multilingual Analyzer

The various modules (lima_*) have different purposes:

 * lima_common
    contains tools shared by all modules (eg. factories)
 * lima_linguisticprocessing
    LIMA linguistic analyser
 * lima_linguisticData
    linguistic ressources used in LIMA

== Install ==

You first need to set up a few environment variables. For this purpose, you can 
run the setenv-lima.sh script from the root of the repository or define them 
manually:

LIMA_DIST      binaries and libraries
LIMA_EXTERNALS dependencies
LIMA_RESOURCES any kind of ressources (including training data)
LIMA_CONF      configuration folder

Once they have been defined, for each module, let's do:
 $ cd module
 $ ../gbuild.sh

The order is important:

1. lima_common
2. lima_linguisticprocessing
3. lima_linguisticData
