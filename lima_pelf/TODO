Code review:
  * read and respect the coding style
  * NEVER do "use namespace std;" in a header
  * in a Qt app, replace stdlib classes by Qt classes
  * OFTEN define members as private (or protected). Define and use read/write accessors


Bugs:
  * when deleting the last evaluation, can no more access to errors of the new last evaluation.
    should reinit the pipeline->startTime
  * should display the errors of the currently selected evaluation and not always the last one
  * correct the statements name display in order to chose the right one to show details of
  * save to settings the list of recent text files
