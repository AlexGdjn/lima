   Basic Description

   The F-200iB is a six & degrees of freedom servo-driven parallel link robot
   designed for use in a variety of manufacturing and automotive assembly
   processes. The F-200iB is < engineered for applications requiring extreme
   rigidity and exceptional repeatability in a compact, powerful package.

   F-200iB, the Solution for:

   ■   Sub-compact robot welding

   ■    Pedestal welding

   ■    Part loading/positioning

   ■    Nut running

   ■   Vehicle lift and locate

   ■    Flexible/convertible fixturing

   ■    Material Removal

   ■    Dispense

   Benefits

   ■   Provides flexibility and convertability - the ability to reprogram the
   F-200iB facilitates rapid and cost-effective model changeovers.

   ■    Reduces capital expense -F-200iB process solutions take less time and
   money to process and design. They also reduce tooling and build costs.

   ■    Lowers operating expense -using the F-200iB reduces tooling complexity,
   resulting in less maintenance and down time.

   ■    Optimizes use of floorspace -the sub-compact F-200iB can fit in spaces
   too cramped for serial link robots.

   ■    Makes it feasible to perform more welds per station, thus reducing the
   number of stations per system.

   ■    New process possibilities -the F-200iB opens the door to new process
   solutions not available with current tools.

   ■    Provides additional options for line balancing.

   ■    Easy and quick to set up, tune-in and debug - F-200iB uses the same
   software as other FANUC robots.

   ■    No special electrical or mechanical training needed -basics are the
   same as any other robot.

   ■    Standardized system requires less retraining at changeover.

   ■    Compact size adds application versatility.
